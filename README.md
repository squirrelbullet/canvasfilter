#Canvasfilter
============

Basic HTML canvas image filter for a running project.

3 basic image filter effects:

###1. Grayscale

Simplely remove the color of the image.

###2. Mirror

Flip the right half part of the image to left part.

###3. Shatter

"Break" the glass.

Though the actual project is now closed, these repository can be still considered as a filter algorithm playground.
